#General Instructions
    To operate both client and server Cryptodome is needed.
    This can be resolved by typing in "pip install pycryptodomex"
    If the installation folder "Cryptodome" is not in the same folder
    as the solutions, it must be moved from where it was installed to
    the folder in which the client and server operate.
    
    Encryptor.py is needed for both client.py and server.py. It should
    be stored in the same folder as both the solutions.
